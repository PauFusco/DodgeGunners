## List of difficulties, comments and bugs
### Known bugs
- IP that appears in Menu is the one from the teacher's computer, will be changed into 6-digit codes to enter to help the user experience and avoid having to search for the IP in console
- Healthbars and Svore do not always display correctly, Will be corrected by passing the information through the net in next delivery

### For next delivery
For this delivery we wanted to focus on the projectiles, as most of the game needed to have the projectiles in order to function and develop it.
As now we have done the projectiles, for next delivery:
- 6 digit code to join room: Work in progress, avoids having to search for the IP in console and helps the user as there are less digits to enter
- Use Amazon web server for the game server
- Pass the health and score through the net to have correct information
